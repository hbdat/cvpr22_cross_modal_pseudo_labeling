# Open-Vocabulary Instance Segmentation via Robust Cross-Modal Pseudo-Labeling

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of [Open-Vocabulary Instance Segmentation via Robust Cross-Modal Pseudo-Labeling](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Huynh_Open-Vocabulary_Instance_Segmentation_via_Robust_Cross-Modal_Pseudo-Labeling_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf).
> In this work, we address open-vocabulary instance segmentation, which learn to segment novel objects without any mask annotation during training by generating pseudo masks based on captioned images.
